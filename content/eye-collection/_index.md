**You can help physically challenged people in 5 minutes!**

## Who We Are

We are a team at [Prof. Gary Bishop's lab](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~gb/), [Dept. of Computer Science](https://cs.unc.edu), University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. We are trying to apply deep learning and computer vision to recognize the eye gaze of physically challenged people (e.g. people with [ALS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis), aka Lou Gehrig's disease). You can contribute to this project by visiting our [data collection website](https://patrickma.me/eye-tracking/collection/collection.html)!

## Instructions for using the website

### Prerequisites

1. A laptop or desktop with a web camera. No mobile devices please.
2. A Chrome browser
3. Enough light
4. A warm-hearted person (like you! :D)

### Usage

Visit the data collection website [here](https://patrickma.me/eye-tracking/collection/collection.html). 

1. The website will prompt you to enable the webcam, press "Allow" to proceed. 

   >  If it shows *Your browser does not seem to support getUserMedia*, please make sure you use Chrome and input the URL with the *https://* prefix.

2. After you see yourself in the upper left video at the website, make sure your FULL face is well lighted and can be seen clearly. The website will track your face landmarks in a few second!

3. Well done! Now your face is being detected by the state-of-art technology.  There should be a rectangle around your eyes. If its position is not correct, please change your head pose.

4. **Please keep the distance between your head and the webcam constant during the process. If possible put a book or box under you chin to fix your head pose.** 

5. Move your eye gaze (without adjusting your head pose) to the blue butterfly on the screen now, press the arrow under it on your keyboard. After pressing the correct key, the last collected example will be shown on the upperright corner. Your eye data will be sent to our database automatically.

6. If your are not satisfied with the last example you collected (e.g. closed eyes, blurred photo), press the space key to delete it. You may even delete more examples by hitting the space key continuously.

7. Continue to collect examples by looking at the butterfly and press the correct key. We would like to collect about 100+ examples from each participant.

Here is a video walkthrough of the collection process.
