I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Quora](https://www.quora.com/), work on iOS engineering of GenAI product [Poe](https://poe.com). I enjoy being a generalist engineer, and was a full-stack engineer on Quora Ads products.

During my undergraduate at UNC Chapel Hill, I served as a learning assistant of 2 advanced CS courses, and a research assistant on eye tracking with [Prof. Gary Bishop](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~gb). I developed trading software at [Credit Suisse](https://www.credit-suisse.com/) as a software engineer intern in 2021 summer.
