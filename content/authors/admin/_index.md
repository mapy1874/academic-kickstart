I am currently a tech analyst intern at Creat Suisse, working on Credit eTrading. As a senior at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I am a Learning Assistant for Algorithms&Analysis under the supervision of [Prof. John Majikes](https://cs.unc.edu/people/john-majikes/). Before that, I conducted research on eye tracking with [Prof. Gary Bishop](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~gb/). I enjoy a good Netflix binge but can also be found on fountain pen shows.
